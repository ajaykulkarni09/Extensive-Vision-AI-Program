# Problem Statement:

## Write a neural network that can:
Take 2 inputs:
- An image from the MNIST dataset (say 5), and
- A random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)
and gives two outputs:
- The "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5), and
- The "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network (predict 5 + 7 = 12)
